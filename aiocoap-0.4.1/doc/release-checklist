Notes to the maintainer on what to do during a release
======================================================

* Update NEWS file
* Bump versions in setup.py, aiocoap/meta.py and doc/conf.py, and at the head of NEWS
* Commit: git commit "Prepare $VERSION release"
* Tag it: git tag -as "$VERSION"
* Clean up: git stash -u
* Build it: ./setup.py sdist
* Upload it: twine upload ./dist/aiocoap-"${VERSION}".tar.gz
* Push it: git push github master --tags; git push gitlab master --tags
* log in to readthedocs, add new tag as new version
* Bump versions to add a ".post0"
  * Commit that: git commit -m "Bump version to .post0 to indicate development"

    (This serves to indicate that anything built from git is not identical to
    the last release.)
